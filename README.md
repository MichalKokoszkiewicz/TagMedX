# TagMedX: Open-Source Medical Image Annotation üè•

TagMedX is an open-source web app built with FastAPI, Next.js, and MySQL, designed for medical image tagging ‚Äì both classification and detection. It's a tool for healthcare professionals, such as doctors and medical experts, to annotate medical images remotely for AI systems. 

## üöÄ  Quickstart

```bash

git clone https://github.com/heyimjustalex/TagMedX.git
cd TagMedX

```
Start without frontend, just backend, DB, and DBAdmin
```bash 
docker-compose up --build
```
Start whole project (with frontend)

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose_all.yml up --build
```

## Database

SQL file in /DB/setup.sql (with some random data loading).

### Structure

Each structure modification must result in backend model update of SQLAlchemy in ./backend/models

    User :
        Fields: id, e_mail, password_hash, name, surname, title, role, description, experience
        Purpose:  entity representing a doctor or an admin who controlls datasets
        Relationships: 
            - one-to-many relationship with Membership
            - one-to-many relationship with Examination

    Group:
        Fields: id, name, description
        Purpose: Represents a group or team of users that will mark a some set for example group of dentists marking teeth dataset
        Relationships: 

    Membership:
        Fields: id_user, id_group
        Purpose: Represents the membership of users in groups.
        Relationships: 
            - Many-to-One with User 
            - Many-to-One with Group
  

    Task:

        Fields: id, id_group, max_samples_for_user, name, description, type
        Purpose: Represents tasks or assignments.
        Relationships: Many-to-One with Group.

    Sample:

        Fields: id, id_task, path, format
        Purpose: Represents samples or data to be examined.
        Relationships: Many-to-One with Task.

    Examination:

        Fields: id, id_user, id_sample, to_further_verification, bad_quality
        Purpose: Records information about examinations.
        Relationships: Many-to-One with User and Sample.

    Label:

        Fields: id, id_task, name, description
        Purpose: Represents labels or tags for tasks.
        Relationships: Many-to-One with Task.

    BBox:

        Fields: id, id_examination, id_label, comment, x1, y1, x2, y2
        Purpose: Stores bounding box details.
        Relationships: Many-to-One with Examination and Label.

## Backend

### General

Project has hot-reload with Docker and it gets started with compose.

### Naming conventions

1. Use typing and linter
2. Try to stick to PEP8. 

- methods: snake_case
- classes: PascalCase

### Project structure

Backend project is divided into 3 main folders: features, models, repositories. Features have user-domain specific folders like groups, users or tasks. Each of these subfolders has it's own controllers, schemas and services. Some facts:
- If you want to make new feature make new folder in feature folder
- Models are mapped to MySQL database entities defined in /DB/setup.sql. Any change made to model any of these means the other needs to be changed.
- Backend is dockerized and avaliable at localhost:8000 (You can test endpoints users/1 or /users)
